# DHTexturesmc
DHTexturesmc, is a site built using Bootstrap, html, css, js and php, entirely made by me, starting from 0.
He's under MIT license, because I don't want a headache and I know how the internet works. Feel free if you like something. (I am not a web designer / programmer, maybe the code is pretty dirty in your eyes)
If you want to help too, feel free. It's not a big project, but it's something that an enthusiast like me, I like to keep, sometimes.

This is the second version of the site. I will try to put the first version here as well.


The site is currently hosted free of charge at the services of 000webhost:

Cheers,
